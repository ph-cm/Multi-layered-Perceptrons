# Multi-Layered Perceptrons
## Project Overview

In this project, we will progressively build a simple neural framework from scratch. This framework will be capable of handling both **multi-class classification** and **regression tasks** using multi-layered perceptrons (MLPs), a type of feedforward neural network.

### Key Objectives
- **Understand** the fundamentals of multi-layered perceptrons and their role in machine learning.
- **Implement** a neural framework capable of solving various supervised learning tasks.
- **Learn** the underlying mathematics and coding techniques for building and training MLPs.

### Prerequisites
This project assumes a basic understanding of Python programming, linear algebra, and calculus. Familiarity with neural networks and machine learning is helpful but not required.

### Project Structure
- **Data Preparation:** Handling and preprocessing input data for neural networks.
- **Model Construction:** Building layers, activation functions, and loss functions for MLPs.
- **Training Loop:** Implementing forward and backward propagation, calculating gradients, and updating weights.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring performance on classification and regression tasks.

### Generating, Visualizing, and Analyzing a Synthetic Dataset
In this guide, we'll explain how to create a synthetic dataset and visualize it using Python. The goal is to demonstrate how classification models can be trained and tested using a simple dataset. This example covers key concepts like data generation, splitting into training and testing sets, and visualizing data using scatter plots.
- Generating a dataset using `make_classification` from `sklearn`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Visualizing the dataset using scatter plots.
- Inspecting sample data for verification.

### Machine Learning Problem
Machine learning revolves around creating models that can learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. The goal is to optimize the model to generalize well on unseen data by minimizing a specific loss function.

## üìä Dataset
Suppose we have an input dataset \((X, Y)\), where:
- \(X\) is a set of features (inputs).
- \(Y\) is the corresponding set of labels (outputs).

The type of labels depends on the problem being solved:
- For **regression** tasks: \( y_i \in \mathbb{R} \) (i.e., labels are real-valued).
- For **classification** tasks: Labels are represented as discrete classes \( y_i \in \{0, 1, ..., n\} \).

## üß† Model Representation
In machine learning, a model can be represented as a function:

\[
f_{\theta}(x)
\]

Where:
- \( \theta \) represents the parameters that the model learns during the training process.
- The objective is to adjust \( \theta \) so that the model fits the training data as accurately as possible.

## üéØ Optimization Goal
To optimize our model, we need to minimize a **loss function** \( \mathcal{L} \). This is done by finding the optimal parameters \( \theta \) that result in the best fit:

\[
\theta = \arg \min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(f_{\theta}(X), Y)
\]

- The loss function \( \mathcal{L} \) quantifies the difference between the model's predictions and the actual labels.
- The optimization goal is to find the parameters \( \theta \) that minimize this difference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Loss Function
The choice of the loss function depends on the type of problem being addressed:

- For **regression tasks**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- For **classification tasks**:
  - **Cross-Entropy Loss**
  - **Hinge Loss**

The loss function guides the model on how to adjust its parameters to improve performance.
