# Multi-Layered Perceptrons
## Project Overview

In this project, we will progressively build a simple neural framework from scratch. This framework will be capable of handling both **multi-class classification** and **regression tasks** using multi-layered perceptrons (MLPs), a type of feedforward neural network.

### Key Objectives
- **Understand** the fundamentals of multi-layered perceptrons and their role in machine learning.
- **Implement** a neural framework capable of solving various supervised learning tasks.
- **Learn** the underlying mathematics and coding techniques for building and training MLPs.

### Prerequisites
This project assumes a basic understanding of Python programming, linear algebra, and calculus. Familiarity with neural networks and machine learning is helpful but not required.

### Project Structure
- **Data Preparation:** Handling and preprocessing input data for neural networks.
- **Model Construction:** Building layers, activation functions, and loss functions for MLPs.
- **Training Loop:** Implementing forward and backward propagation, calculating gradients, and updating weights.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring performance on classification and regression tasks.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository**:
